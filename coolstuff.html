        <h1>Cool Stuff</h1>
        <p>
          These are just cool things I like around the internet. 
          Big or small, I just think they're neat.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <a href="https://tcrf.net">TCRF</a> - A wiki for unearthing unseen content in video games.
            A bit of "video game archeology". It's really cool to me and I've even contributed myself a few times.
            Perfect site to visit if I have a terrible connection and need something to read.
          </li>
          <li>
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org">Wikipedia</a> - I mean this one really needs no introduction, but the amount of 
            time I spend just browsing around random interesting articles in my downtime warrants me putting it up here.
            I have contributed a few things before too, but not much.
            I get a kick out of seeing how some notable articles change over time :P
          </li>
          <li>
            <a href="https://web.archive.org">The Wayback Machine</a> - Truly one of the most important archives of the modern age.
            This website is even in there! Though, you're not really missing much on that front.
          </li>
          <li>
            <a href="https://www.beepbox.co/">BeepBox</a> - A great chiptune online sequencer. I have made many game jam tunes using it!
          </li>

        <h1>COMING SOON!</h1>
        <img src="static/img/tortle.jpg" width="300px" alt="picture of a dog and a turtle being silly">
        <p>
          I want to make pages for some of my other hobbies.
          Dedicated sections of the site for them.
          Stuff like, what games I'm playing, what music I'm listening to,
          past D&D campaigns, consoles I've modded.
        </p>
        <p>
          Just like, snippets of my life. On my own personal site.
          Organized and tucked away for the world to see, if they wish.
        </p>
        <p>
          But yeah! I think first and foremost I'll need a better way to 
          publish these pages without relinking everything in the navbar.
          But beyond that, you could expect to really see more of that soon!
          Yippee!!
