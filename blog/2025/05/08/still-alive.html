          Wow! Is this another blog post?
        </p>

          Truly amazing.

          Well, I still haven't automated the pipeline at all, and it
          has been like... (checks notes)... oh, 7 months. That's 
          interesting. Time sure gets away from ya doesn't it.

          In all seriousness, college certainly gets busy, and other things
          have had priority for a while, but things are soon to be changing.
          I should hopefully end up with considerably more free time in the 
          near future, and I'm excited about that. I hope to *finally* give
          this website the automated refresh it deserves. It would certainly
          make things easier to contribute to on a whim.

          For the record, I added this post completely manually. Still no
          site builder automation quite yet. There's something quite fun about
          being so raw with the html, but I definitely want to make this 
          render nicely from Markdown instead of HTML tags.
        </p>
        <p>
          And automatic linking together of things.
          I gotta go link this blog post somewhere lest I forget...
        </p>
        <p>
          Anyways hopefully real soon this will be nice and automated.
          Look forward to it lol.
