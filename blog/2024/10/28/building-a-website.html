          Wow! Is this a blog post?
        </p>
        <p>
          Who knows. What I do know is this: I would like to be able to post and manage my content as I please. I am not entirely sure how to go about this, though.
          I know tools like Jekyll exist, but frankly I kinda want to make my own thing.
          Maybe something to take in my Markdown files that I love to write so much and turn them into HTML.
          Is that something I could do with a template?
          Maybe a build action?
        </p>

          Right now I host this freely on GitHub Pages. Everything here is statically hosted, and everything so far has been hand-made.
          While that's cool and all, I know that's not going to be scalable long term. I should really figure out a way to handle this cleaner.
          Heck, even the timestamp right now is merely an estimate of when this would go live.
          I also think some further styling might be nicer.
          Perhaps neon green on dim blue isn't the best to read an entire masterpiecec on.

          Anyways, yeah. The big thing here is to figure out a way to deploy
          these in an automated way. Templates for sure. I don't want to keep
          manually updating the navbar everytime I have an update.
        </p>

          But anyways, enough of that ramble. First blog post!
