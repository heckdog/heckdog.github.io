        <h1>BLOG UNDER CONSTRUCTION</h1>
        <p>
          I am no professional writer by any means, but I have a few hobbies I'd like to share about!
          I am into music, D&D, video games, and niche old internet things. I might 
          even make a separate section just on cool links or things that I find around the internet.
          This page in particular will be my space to write on any of these things in more depth, maybe!
        </p>
        <p>
          But for now, this space can act as a site change log!
        </p>
        <h2>Site Change Log:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Some time in April 2024 - First nzben.net site goes live.</li>
          <li>Early May 2024 - Make basic site using React and Netlify</li>
          <li>Late May 2024 - Make minor edits to that site, ultimately dead in the water.</li>
          <li>Early October 2024 - Start developing new site on GitHub Pages. Just a Hello World.</li>
          <li>10/28/2024 - Make the current version of the site. Contains an About page, Home, "blog", and empty funnies page.
            The netlify site is still live (but not for much longer)
          </li>
          <li>
            10/28/2024 9:10pm - Push this version of the site. Waiting for it to go live!
          </li>
          <li>
            10/28/2024 9:36pm - Possibly connected to domain? Not entirely sure. DNS errors everywhere.
          </li>
          <li>
            10/28/204 9:47pm - It's actually live!
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>
